.SH NAME
jigdo-lite \- Download jigdo files using wget
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBjigdo-lite\fR [ \fBURL\fR] 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Given the URL of a `\fI.jigdo\fR' file,
\fBjigdo-lite\fR downloads the large file (e.g. a CD
image) that has been made available through that URL.
\fBwget\fR(1) is used to download the necessary
pieces of administrative data (contained in the
`\fI.jigdo\fR' file and a corresponding
`\fI.template\fR' file) as well as the many pieces
that the large file is made from. The
\fBjigdo-file\fR(1) utility is used to reconstruct the
large file from the pieces.
.PP
`\fI.jigdo\fR' files that contain references
to Debian mirrors are treated specially: When such a file is
recognized, you are asked to select one mirror out of a list of
all Debian mirrors.
.PP
If \fBURL\fR is not given on the command line,
the script prompts for a location to download the
`\fI.jigdo\fR' file from.
