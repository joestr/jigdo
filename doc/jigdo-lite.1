.SH NAME
jigdo-lite \- Download jigdo files using wget
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBjigdo-lite\fR [ \fBURL\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
See \fBjigdo-file\fR(1) for an introduction to
Jigsaw Download.
.PP
Given the URL of a `\fI\&.jigdo\fR\&' file,
\fBjigdo-lite\fR downloads the large file (e.g. a CD
image) that has been made available through that URL.
\fBwget\fR(1) is used to download the necessary
pieces of administrative data (contained in the
`\fI\&.jigdo\fR\&' file and a corresponding
`\fI\&.template\fR\&' file) as well as the many pieces
that the large file is made from. The
\fBjigdo-file\fR(1) utility is used to reconstruct the
large file from the pieces.
.PP
`\fI\&.jigdo\fR\&' files that contain references
to Debian mirrors are treated specially: When such a file is
recognized, you are asked to select one mirror out of a list of
all Debian mirrors.
.PP
If \fBURL\fR is not given on the command line,
the script prompts for a location to download the
`\fI\&.jigdo\fR\&' file from. The following command
line options are recognized:
.TP
\fB-h --help\fR
Output short summary of command syntax.
.TP
\fB-v --version\fR
Output version number.
.TP
\fB--scan \fIFILES\fB\fR
Do not ask for "Files to scan", use this path.
.TP
\fB--noask\fR
Do not ask any questions, instead behave as if the
user had pressed Return at all prompts. This can be useful
when running \fBjigdo-lite\fR from cron jobs or
in other non-interactive environments.
