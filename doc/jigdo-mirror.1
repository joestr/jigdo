.SH NAME
jigdo-mirror \- Maintain a mirror of images offered with jigdo
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBjigdo-mirror\fR [ \fBconfig-file\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
See \fBjigdo-file\fR(1) for an introduction to
Jigsaw Download.
.PP
\fBjigdo-mirror\fR is a script intended for
people who want to offer direct HTTP or FTP downloads of files for
which only the jigdo and template files are available.
.PP
As the first step of using \fBjigdo-mirror\fR,
you need to set up normal HTTP/FTP/rsync mirroring both of the
`\fI\&.jigdo\fR\&'/`\fI\&.template\fR\&'
files and of the parts that are needed for the reconstruction of
the images. For example, in the case that you want to mirror
Debian CD images with \fBjigdo-mirror\fR, you need a
mirror of the
`\fI\&.jigdo\fR\&'/`\fI\&.template\fR\&'
files and a Debian mirror on the local machine.
.PP
At regular intervals (preferably immediately after the
normal mirroring has finished), schedule a run of
\fBjigdo-mirror\fR\&. It will search through a given
directory for any `\fI\&.jigdo\fR\&' files and attempt
to create all images offered by each file.
.PP
The script requires you to set a number of variables -
please refer to the start of
\fI/usr/bin/jigdo-mirror\fR for a description of
each of them. Since \fI/usr/bin/jigdo-mirror\fR
will be overwritten whenever you upgrade
\fBjigdo-mirror\fR, it is highly recommended
\fBnot\fR to change the settings directly in this
script. Instead, personal settings should be saved in a file
called \fI\&.jigdo-mirror\fR in your home directory,
or in a different file whose name is then passed to the script as
its first (and only) command line argument.

images for the Debian Linux distribution more convenient.
