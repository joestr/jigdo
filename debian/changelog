jigdo (0.7.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * jigdo-file: Bugfix for the code which deduces missing --image/

jigdo (0.6.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * jigdo-lite: When temporary dir is already present, scan its
    contents *before* downloading the first batch of files,
    closes: #153643
  * jigdo-file: Prevent infinite loop if I/O error occurs during
    scanning of files, closes: #153947
  * jigdo-lite: Use a separate temporary dir for each new download. 
    This allows you to run several jigdo-lite instances in the same
    dir at the same time, closes: #154338
  * Improved handling of invalid cache files (created if disc gets
    full during cache update): Instead of crashing, jigdo-file prints
    an error. However, libdb still corrupts the cache file,
    closes: #163721
  * jigdo-lite supports a --scan command line option to avoid the
    "Files to scan" question, closes: #176947
  * Conflicts: jigdo (<< 0.6.9) because of jigdo.mo in both packages,
    just to allow for smooth upgrade for people using my unofficial
    jigdo package.
  * Added the Debian jigdo mini-HOWTO to the doc directory
