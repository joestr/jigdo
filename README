To build the programs, execute:
    ./configure && make

After a successful build, you can install the program (by default into
/usr/local) with

   make install

To build Debian packages (.deb) from the sources, execute:
    deb/rules

To compile jigdo-file on the old Debian "potato" release, use:
    ./configure --without-libdb --without-gui && make

To build an RPM package (.rpm) from the sources, execute:
    rpm -ba jigdo.spec

To build a .tar.gz with binaries and documentation, execute:
    ./configure && make bindist

Apart from the usual options (see "./configure --help"), the configure
script also recognizes the following options:
  --with-libdb        Use libdb3 (necessary for jigdo-file's cache) [yes]
  --with-gui          Build the jigdo GUI application [yes]
  --with-uint64=TYPE  Specify unsigned type of at least 64 bits [auto]
                      (Replace spaces with underscores in TYPE)
  --enable-nls        Use Native Language Support [yes]
  --enable-debug      Compile in lots of additional debugging code [no]
  --enable-ccmalloc   Use the ccmalloc memory leak detector [no]
