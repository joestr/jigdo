jigdo 0.6.5 -- Richard Atterer, 

  - jigdo-lite: Better fallback handling, now also works for files
    that changed (rather than disappeared) on the server.
  - jigdo-lite: If ~/.jigdo-lite not present, try to fetch mirror info
    from /etc/apt/sources.list
  - portability fixes (Mattias Wadenstein)
  - jigdo GUI: Some more work done, but it's still not usable

jigdo 0.6.4 -- Richard Atterer, 02 Mar 2002

  - Fixed a make-template bug introduced in 0.6.3, which caused
    jigdo-file to crash if there are more than 32 files with identical
    content (Attila Nagy)
  - jigdo-lite: Allow customization of flags passed to jigdo-file and
    wget, by making it save and restore variables in ~/.jigdo-lite.
    For example, add "--uri Debian=http://myserver.lan/" to the
    definition of jigdoOpts to define an additional mirror (turns the
    selected mirrors into fallback mirrors).
  - jigdo-lite: Made script work with ash
  - Added configure check for _snprintf (needed for Windows)

jigdo 0.6.3 -- Richard Atterer, 24 Feb 2002

  - jigdo-file make-template: Some loop unrolling, some other
    optimizations, resulting in a speed increase of at least 30%!
  - FORMAT CHANGE of template files: Template data now includes
    RsyncSums - this will be useful in the future for aborting
    downloads early and when upgrading images to newer versions. This
    version still reads the old template format, but support for that
    will be dropped before 1.0.0.
  - jigdo-lite: Can now supply >1 image sections in .jigdo files
  - jigdo-lite: Support for gzipped .jigdo files
  - jigdo-lite: Added a small manpage
  - jigdo-lite: Use "wget --dot-style=mega --passive-ftp"
  - Really fixed <sstream> issues this time - by not using sstream at
    all. (It is not possible to implement an sstream class for the
    iostream supplied with Debian Potato's GCC 2.95)
  - Can now build a .deb just by executing "deb/rules"
  - configure: Can now use --without-gui to prevent jigdo GUI from
    getting built and installed (does not work with "deb/rules")
  - Added jigdo.spec for building of RPMs (Alexander Skwar)
  - Slightly changed the way that missing --image/--jigdo/--template
    arguments are deduced from other parameters. (Thomas Arnold)
  - Fixes to make jigdo-file build on 64-bit architectures
  - Changed abbreviation of "md5sum" command from "md" to "md5". That
    breaks compatibility, but I keep typing "md5"... :)
  - Small hack to make "jigdo-file md5 /some/path" include the leading
    "/" in its output.
  - jigdo-lite: Fix for obscure problem with "sed /foo/!p" on BSD and
    some Linux versions - use "egrep -v foo" instead (Attila Nagy)

jigdo 0.6.2 -- Richard Atterer, 26 Jan 2002

  - Added this changelog file to the distribution! :-)
  - gettext support (but no translations are present yet)
  - Portability fixes to jigdo-lite (Anne Bezemer)
  - Portability fixes to the jigdo-file code (for RedHat/Mandrake
    systems, systems without <sstream> such as Debian Potato)
  - Support for fallback servers in jigdo-lite
  - Support for fallback servers in jigdo-file, in the form of a new
    "print-missing-all" command
  - First upload of jigdo packages to the Debian archive

jigdo 0.6.1 -- Richard Atterer, 17 Dec 2001

  - Changelog lost

jigdo 0.6.0 -- Richard Atterer, 15 Nov 2001

  - Because the "proper jigdo" (the GTK+ download manager type app) is
    not going to be finished anytime soon, I've written a small shell
    script called "jigdo-lite" which does an equivalent job. It
    downloads files with wget and assembles them using jigdo-file.
    jigdo-lite can "upgrade" old images to a newer version.
  - Very first, ***pre-alpha*** version of the GTK+ jigdo application.
    There is no download capability or other functionality present at
    all yet.
  - As of a few days ago, the first beta site offering downloads of
    Debian 2.2r4 via jigdo is available on cdimage. Thanks for the
    account to Phil Hands!

jigdo 0.5.3 -- Richard Atterer, 13 Sep 2001

  - *** jigdo-file is finished! ***
    With the introduction of a cache for file checksums, it is finally
    possible in practice to let it loose on a Debian archive mirror.
  - Update and large extension of the documentation.
  - Now compiles with GCC 3.
  - Now compiles under Windows! You do not even need Cygwin; plain
    mingw is sufficient.
  - Numerous small fixes and changes. Source code now exceeds 10000
    lines of code.

jigdo 0.5.2 -- Richard Atterer, 2 Sep 2001

  - Would you believe it, documentation!!! (in the form of a manpage)
  - "print-missing" sub-command for jigdo-file allows for mirror
    selection etc - more than the old PIK's functionality is now
    present
  - Major internal extensions (nearly 2000 lines of code) which don't
    show now, but which will eventually come in handy for the GUI tool

jigdo 0.5.1 -- Richard Atterer, 22 Jul 2001

  - Can now merge files into a half-finished image with >1 jigdo-file
    invocations. This will be useful e.g. to "upgrade Debian CD
    images", i.e. you can take some .debs from the old CD, so they
    needn't be downloaded again.
  - Can assign labels to input file locations, e.g. "--label
    /opt/mirrors/debian=Debian"
  - Cleanup & extension of .jigdo file format

jigdo 0.5.0 -- Richard Atterer, about 20 Jun 2001

  - Initial release, not very usable.

jigdo 0.0.0 -- Richard Atterer, December 2000

  - Discussion on debian-cd, jigdo enters vapourware stage.
